As you can see, I have already created a basic Next.js application.
In the file "app/page.tsx", I want you to create the following elements:

A list of Arabic alphabet letters. For each letter (e.g., Alif, Bâ, Tâ, Thâ, etc.), we should have:

Its solar or lunar quality
Its articulation point (Makharij)
Its phonetic transcription
The calligraphic representation of the letter in Arabic
The ability to hear its pronunciation
A search field where the user can select a letter.

The selected letter should appear, and the user should be able to validate it.
Once the letter is validated, display a text like:

"Selected letter: Alif"
If no letter has been chosen, display:
"You must search for a letter using the search bar above."
If the user has validated a letter, display all the information related to the selected letter (Solar/Lunar classification, pronunciation, phonetics, articulation point, etc.).
